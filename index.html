				<h2>About Beautiful Larkspur</h2>
				<p>Located centrally in Alberta, Larkspur is a quiet, small summer village with a population of 53. It is beautifully sitting beside Long Island Lake. Due to the similarity of the landscape to the flower Larkspur, the town has adopted its name. The tiny village was governed by Mayor Jason Meliefste and supported by Westlock County. </p>

					<h2>Larkspur Library</h2>
					<p>Larkspur Village has its first library in town. Managed by a volunteer librarian Koni Getschel, the small building or hut is by the hall and can notice quickly. The construction is a small wood house with a lovely painting from one of the residents. The Summer Village purchased this project to benefit their residents all summer long.</p>
