						<h2>About Beautiful Larkspur</h2>
						<p>Alberta has full of beautiful small towns. Though large cities like Calgary, Edmonton, or Red Deer, are often considered culture and beauty capitals, this doesn't mean other locales can't be beacons of these qualities too. Located centrally in Alberta, Larkspur is a quiet, small summer village with a population of 53. This charming enclave is where beauty takes shape in the form of lakes, mountains, historic main streets, forests, and architectural splendour, among other picturesque qualities. It is beautifully sitting beside Long Island Lake. Due to the similarity of the landscape to the flower Larkspur, the town has adopted its name. The tiny village was governed by Mayor Jason Meliefste and supported by Westlock County.</p>

					<h2>Getting to Larkspur</h2>
					<p>Summertime vacation or a small day trip is always the best. Living in Canada, it is essential to cherish that short inter-season, aka summer, in this frigid country. We always look forward to taking a break from the city centre and getting lost in a place where you can be free and peaceful. Larkspur summer village is just around the corner for you! The driving distance from downtown Edmonton to Larkspur Village is only around 127 kilometres. You will need about 1.5 hours to travel by car. On the other hand, if you depart from Calgary, it will take about 3 hours to drive to the village. Unfortunately, there is no public transport available in this small town. But on the bright side, this is a sign of your peacefulness achieved! (Hint: No public transport, not too many people around!) </p>

					<h2>Larkspur Library</h2>
					<p>Despite the size of the population, people living in this tiny town are building a solid yet comprehensive neighbourhood to enrich the local's quality of life. Larkspur Village has its first library in the city. Managed by a volunteer librarian Koni Getschel, the small building or hut is by the hall and can notice quickly. The construction is a small wood house with a lovely painting from one of the residents. The Summer Village purchased this project to benefit their residents all summer long. The library also hosts events throughout the year. One of the most popular events is "Family Storytime." This event is a program for parents with young children. Songs, rhymes, and stories are shared. This event is also suitable for children of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn together.</p>
