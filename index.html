				<h2>About Beautiful Larkspur</h2>
				<p>Located centrally in Alberta, Larkspur is a quiet, small summer village with a population of 53. It is beautifully sitting beside Long Island Lake. Due to the similarity of the landscape to the flower Larkspur, the town has adopted its name. The tiny village was governed by Mayor Jason Meliefste and supported by Westlock County. </p>

					<p>Larkspur is away from the urban city, gifted by the natural scenery and wildlife. You can see deer and caribou in the forest of Larkspur, as well as a rich collection of birdlife. Besides birdwatching, kayaking and floating on Long Island Lake are the most popular activities in Larkspur during the summertime. Motorcycle or off-road trails are also available during summer and winter for more active activities. </p>

					<h2>Larkspur Library</h2>
					<p>Larkspur Village has its first library in town. Managed by a volunteer librarian Koni Getschel, the small building or hut is by the hall and can notice quickly. The construction is a small wood house with a lovely painting from one of the residents. The Summer Village purchased this project to benefit their residents all summer long.</p>
